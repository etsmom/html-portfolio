<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>On January 2023, my family and I moved from Virginia to California. 
  I drove a 26 foot U-haul while my son road next to me in the passanager seat.
  My daughter and our friend drove my car in front to relay road hazards while our
  little dog "Pip" made hisself at home in the backseat.

<p>Currently I am a traveling surgical technologist but that is going to change with the help of this class.
I want to return to what I enjoy doing the most which is being creative an coding. The one thing I have learned
over the years is you have to initiate change with a little hard work.</p>
